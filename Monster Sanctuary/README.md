Download/Clone the dll file and replace the dll file in your steamapps/common/Monster Sanctuary/Monster Sanctuary_Data/Managed with this one.

There is no need to back up - if there is any issues you can go in to Monster Sanctuary properties -> local files -> verify integrity of game files on Steam.
This will set the .dll file back to the original.
